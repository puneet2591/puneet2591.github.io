Are you good at a sport? Musical instrument? Art? Can you computer code? Maybe you’re a juggler? If you have a skill, regardless of how popular or obscure, chances are someone else is trying to learn that skill.

Wouldn’t it have been great if someone in your area was willing to teach you in person, at an affordable price the skills it took you forever to learn?
Sayge does just that! Sayge connects people like you, with a skill, with someone near you who wants to learn that skill.

Human beings have an innate desire to learn. In fact, 74% of adults regularly invest their time and/or money into personal learning activities. If you possess an interesting skill, there’s a good chance somebody in your area wants to learn it!

<div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/sayge/sayge3.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
</div>
<!-- <div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div> -->

<!-- The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
</div>
``` -->

{% endraw %}
